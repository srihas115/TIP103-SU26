# Problem 5: Super Sandwich II

Below is an iterative solution to the `merge_orders()` function from the previous problem. Compare your recursive solution to the iterative solution below.

Discuss with your podmates. Which solution do you prefer? How do they compare on time complexity? Space complexity?

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

# For testing
def print_linked_list(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.value, end=" -> " if current.next else "\n")
        current = current.next

def merge_orders(sandwich_a, sandwich_b):
    # If either list is empty, return the other
    if not sandwich_a:
        return sandwich_b
    if not sandwich_b:
        return sandwich_a

    # Start with the first node of sandwich_a
    head = sandwich_a
    
    # Loop through both lists until one is exhausted
    while sandwich_a and sandwich_b:
        # Store the next pointers
        next_a = sandwich_a.next
        next_b = sandwich_b.next
        
        # Merge sandwich_b after sandwich_a
        sandwich_a.next = sandwich_b
        
        # If there's more in sandwich_a, add it after sandwich_b
        if sandwich_a:
            sandwich_b.next = next_a
        
        # Move to the next nodes
        sandwich_a = next_a
        sandwich_b = next_b

    # Return the head of the new merged list
    return head
```
