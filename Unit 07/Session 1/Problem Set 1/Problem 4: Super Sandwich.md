# Problem 4: Super Sandwich

A regular at the deli has requested a new order made by merging two different sandwiches on the menu together. Given the heads of two linked lists `sandwich_a` and `sandwich_b` where each node in the lists contains a sandwich layer, write a recursive function `merge_orders()` that merges the two sandwiches together in the pattern:

`a1 -> b1 -> a2 -> b2 -> a3 -> b3 -> ...` 

Return the head of the merged sandwich.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

# For testing
def print_linked_list(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.value, end=" -> " if current.next else "\n")
        current = current.next

def merge_orders(sandwich_a, sandwich_b)
    pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
sandwich_a = Node('Bacon', Node('Lettuce', Node('Tomato')))
sandwich_b = Node('Turkey', Node('Cheese', Node('Mayo')))
sandwich_c = Node('Bread')

print_linked_list(merge_orders(sandwich_a, sandwich_b))
print_linked_list(merge_orders(sandwich_a, sandwich_c))
```

Example Output:

```markdown
Bacon -> Turkey -> Lettuce -> Cheese -> Tomato -> Mayo
Bacon -> Bread -> Lettuce -> Tomato
```
