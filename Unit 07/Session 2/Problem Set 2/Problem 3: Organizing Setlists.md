# Problem 3: Organizing Setlists

You are planning a series of concerts and have a list of potential songs for the setlist, each with a specific duration. You want to create a setlist that maximizes the number of songs while ensuring that the total duration of the setlist does not exceed the time limit set for the concert.

Given an integer array `song_durations` where each element represents the duration of a song and an integer array `concert_limits` where each element represents the total time limit available for a concert, return an array `setlist_sizes` where `setlist_sizes[i]` is the maximum number of songs you can include in the playlist for concert `i` such that the total duration of the setlist is less than or equal to `concert_limits[i]`. 

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

```python
def concert_playlists(song_durations, concert_limits):
    pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
song_durations1 = [4, 3, 1, 2]
concert_limits1 = [5, 10, 15]

song_durations2 = [2, 3, 4, 5]
concert_limits2 = [1]

print(concert_playlists(song_durations1, concert_limits1))
print(concert_playlists(song_durations2, concert_limits2))
```

Example Output:

```markdown
[2, 4, 4]
Example 1 Explanation: 
- [3, 2] has a sum less than or equal to 5, thus 2 songs can be played at concert 1.
- [4, 3, 1, 2] has a sum less than or equal to 10, thus 4 songs can be played at concert 2.
- [4, 3, 1, 2] has a sum less than or equal to 15, thus 4 songs can be played at concert 2.

[0]
Example 2 Explanation: 
- No songs are less than 1 minute long, so zero songs can be played at the concert.
