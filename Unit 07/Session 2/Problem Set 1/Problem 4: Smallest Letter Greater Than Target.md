# Problem 4: Smallest Letter Greater Than Target

You are given an array of characters `letters` that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character `target`. There are at least two different characters in letters.

Write a function `next_greatest_letter()` that returns the smallest character in `letters` that is lexicographically greater than target. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in `letters`.

Lexicographic order can also be defined as alphabetic order.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

```python
def next_greatest_letter(letters, target):
    pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
letters = ['a', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'e', 'h', 'w']

print(next_greatest_letter(letters, 'a'))
print(next_greatest_letter(letters, 'd'))
print(next_greatest_letter(letters, 'y'))
```

Example Output:

```markdown
b
Example 1 Explanation: The smallest character lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'b'

e
Example 2 Explanation: The smallest character lexicographically greater than 'd' in letters is 'e'

a
Example 3 Explanation: There is no character lexicographically greater than 'y' in letters
so we return letters[0]
```
