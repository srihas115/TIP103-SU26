# Problem 3: Find First and Last Frequency Positions

The Rebel Alliance has intercepted a crucial sequence of encrypted transmissions from the evil Empire. Each transmission is marked with a unique frequency code, represented as integers, and these codes are stored in a sorted array `transmissions`. As a skilled codebreaker for the Rebellion, write a function `find_frequency_positions()` that returns a tuple with the first and last indices of a specific frequency code `target_code` in `transmissions`. If `target_code` does not exist in `transmissions`, return `(-1, -1)`. 

Your solution must have `O(log n)` time complexity.

```python
def find_frequency_positions(transmissions, target_code):
    pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
print(find_frequency_positions([5,7,7,8,8,10], 8))
print(find_frequency_positions([5,7,7,8,8,10], 6))
print(find_frequency_positions([], 0))
```

Example Output:

```markdown
(3, 4)
(-1, -1)
(-1, -1)
```
