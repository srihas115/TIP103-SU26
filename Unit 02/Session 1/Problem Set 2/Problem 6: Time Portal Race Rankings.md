# Problem 6: Time Portal Race Rankings

A group of time travelers are competing in a series of races to see who can hop through time portals the fastest, from the medieval era to the year 4050.

You're given a list of race outcomes in the form of an integer array`races`, where each element`races[i] = [winner, loser]`indicates that the traveler`winner`defeated the traveler`loser`in a race.

Write a function`find_travelers()`that accepts the integer array`races`as a parameter and returns a list`answer`of length 2 where:

`answer[0]`is a list of all travelers who have not lost any races.

`answer[1]`is a list of all travelers who have lost exactly one race.

Both the input list`races`and your output list`answer`should be sorted in**increasing order.**

Note: Only include travelers who have competed in at least one race — that is, those who appear as either a winner or a loser in the input list`races`. For example, if`races = [[1,2], [5, 6]`, that may imply the existence of racers`3`and`4`. However, since neither racer`3`nor`4`is included in the input list,`3`and`4`should also not appear in the output list`answer`.

```
def find_travelers(races):
    pass
```

Example Usage:

```
races1 = [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 6], [5, 6], [5, 7], [4, 5], [4, 8], [4, 9], [10, 4], [10, 9]]
races2 = [[2, 3], [1, 3], [5, 4], [6, 4]]

print(find_travelers(races1))
print(find_travelers(races2))
```

Example Output

```
[[1, 2, 10], [4, 5, 7, 8]]
[[1, 2, 5, 6], []]
```
