# Problem 1: Balanced Art Collection

As the curator of an art gallery, you are organizing a new exhibition. You must ensure the collection of art pieces are balanced to attract the right range of buyers. A balanced collection is one where the difference between the maximum and minimum value of the art pieces is exactly 1.

Given an integer array `art_pieces` representing the value of each art piece, write a function `find_balanced_subsequence()`that returns the length of the longest balanced subsequence.

A **subsequence** is a sequence derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

```
def find_balanced_subsequence(art_pieces):
    pass
```

Example Usage:

```
art_pieces1 = [1,3,2,2,5,2,2,8,3,7]
art_pieces2 = [1,2,3,4]
art_pieces3 = [1,1,1,1]

print(find_balanced_subsequence(art_pieces1))
print(find_balanced_subsequence(art_pieces2))
print(find_balanced_subsequence(art_pieces3))
```

Example Output:

```
5
Example 1 Explanation:  The longest balanced subsequence is [3,2,2,2,2,3].
