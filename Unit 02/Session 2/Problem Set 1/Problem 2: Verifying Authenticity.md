# Problem 2: Verifying Authenticity

Your art gallery has just been shipped a new collection of numbered art pieces, and you need to verify their authenticity. The collection is considered "authentic" if it is a permutation of an array`base[n]`.

The`base[n]`array is defined as`[1, 2, ..., n - 1, n, n]`, meaning it is an array of length`n + 1`containing the integers from`1`to`n - 1`exactly once, and the integer`n`twice. For example,`base[1]`is`[1, 1]`and`base[3]`is`[1, 2, 3, 3]`.

Write a function`is_authentic_collection`that accepts an array of integers`art_pieces`and returns`True`if the given array is an authentic array, and otherwise returns`False`.

Note: A permutation of integers represents an arrangement of these numbers. For example`[3, 2, 1]`and`[2, 1, 3]`are both permutations of the series of numbers`1`,`2`, and`3`.

```python
def is_authentic_collection(art_pieces):
    pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
collection1 = [2, 1, 3]
collection2 = [1, 3, 3, 2]
collection3 = [1, 1]

print(is_authentic_collection(collection1))
print(is_authentic_collection(collection2))
print(is_authentic_collection(collection3))
```

Example Output:

```
False
Example 1 Explanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 3, the only
candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 3.
However, base[3] has four elements but array collection1 has three. Therefore,
it can not be a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3]. So the answer is false.

True
Example 2 Explanation:  Since the maximum element of the array is 3, the only
candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 3.
It can be seen that collection2 is a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3]
(by swapping the second and fourth elements in nums, we reach base[3]).
 Therefore, the answer is true.

True
Example 3 Explanation; Since the maximum element of the array is 1,
the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n],
is n = 1. It can be seen that collection3 is a permutation of base[1] = [1, 1].
 Therefore, the answer is true.
