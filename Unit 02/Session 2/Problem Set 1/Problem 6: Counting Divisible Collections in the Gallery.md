# Problem 6: Counting Divisible Collections in the Gallery

You have a list of integers`collection_sizes`representing the sizes of different art collections in your gallery and are trying to determine how to group them to best fit in your space. Given an integer`k`write a function`count_divisible_collections()`that returns the number of non-empty subarrays (contiguous parts of the array) where the sum of the sizes is divisible by`k`.

```python
def count_divisible_collections(collection_sizes, k):
    pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
nums1 = [4, 5, 0, -2, -3, 1]
k1 = 5
nums2 = [5]
k2 = 9

print(count_divisible_collections(nums1, k1))
print(count_divisible_collections(nums2, k2))
```

Example Output:

```
7
Example 1 Explanation: There are 7 subarrays with a sum divisible by k = 5:
[4, 5, 0, -2, -3, 1], [5], [5, 0], [5, 0, -2, -3], [0], [0, -2, -3], [-2, -3]

0
```
