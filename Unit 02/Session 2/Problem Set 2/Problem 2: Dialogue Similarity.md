# Problem 2: Dialogue Similarity

Watching a reality TV show, you notice a lot of contestants talk similarly. We want to determine if two contestants have similar speech patterns.

We can represent a sentence as an array of words, for example, the sentence`"I've got a text!"`can be represented as`sentence = ["I've", "got", "a", "text"]`.

You are given two sentences from different contestants`sentence1`and`sentence2`each represented as a string array and given an array of string pairs`similar_pairs`where`similar_pairs[i] = [xi, yi]`indicates that the two words`xi`and`yi`are similar. Write a function`is_similar()`that returns`True`if`sentence1`and`sentence2`are similar, and`False`if they are not similar.

Two sentences are similar if:

-   They have**the same length**(i.e., the same number of words)
-   `sentence1[i]`and`sentence2[i]`are similar

Notice that a word is always similar to itself, also notice that the similarity relation is not transitive. For example, if the words`a`and`b`are similar, and the words`b`and`c`are similar,`a`and`c`are not necessarily similar.

```python
def is_similar(sentence1, sentence2, similar_pairs):
    pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
sentence1 = ["my", "type", "on", "paper"]
sentence2 = ["my", "type", "in", "theory"]
similar_pairs = [ ["on", "in"], ["paper", "theory"]]

sentence3 = ["no", "tea", "no", "shade"]
sentence4 = ["no", "offense"]
similar_pairs2 = [["shade", "offense"]]

print(is_similar(sentence1, sentence2, similar_pairs))
print(is_similar(sentence3, sentence4, similar_pairs2))
```

Example Output:

```
True
Example 1 Explanation: "my" and "type" are similar to themselves. The words at
indices 2 and 3 of sentence1 are similar to words at indices 2 and 3 of
sentence2 according to the similar_pairs array.

False
Example 2 Explanation: Sentences are of different length.
```
