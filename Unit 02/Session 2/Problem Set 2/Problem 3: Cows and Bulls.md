# Problem 3: Cows and Bulls

In a reality TV show, contestants play a mini-game called [Bulls and Cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_cows) for a prize. The objective is to guess a secret number within a limited number of attempts. You, as the host, need to provide hints to the contestants based on their guesses.

When a contestant makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following information:

-   The number of "bulls," which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
-   The number of "cows," which are digits in the guess that are in the secret number but are located in the wrong position.

Given the secret number`secret`and the contestant's guess`guess`, return the hint for their guess.

The hint should be formatted as`"xAyB"`, where`x`is the number of bulls and`y`is the number of cows. Note that both`secret`and`guess`may contain duplicate digits.

```python
def get_hint(secret, guess):
    pass
```

Example Input:

```python
secret1 = "1807"
guess1 = "7810"

secret2 = "1123"
guess2 = "0111"

print(get_hint(secret1, guess1))
print(get_hint(secret2, guess2))
```

Example Output:

```
1A3B
Example 1 Explanation:
Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are marked with an asterisk:
"1807"
  |
"7810"
 * **

1A1B
Example 2 Explanation:
Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are marked with an asterisk:
"1123"        "1123"
  |      or     |
"0111"        "0111"
   *              *
Note that only one of the two unmatched 1s is counted as a cow since the
non-bull digits can only be rearranged to allow one 1 to be a bull.
