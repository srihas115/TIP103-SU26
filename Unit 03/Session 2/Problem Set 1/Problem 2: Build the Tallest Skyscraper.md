# Problem 2: Build the Tallest Skyscraper

You are given an array `floors` representing the heights of different building floors. Your task is to design a skyscraper using these floors, where each floor must be placed on top of a floor with equal or greater height. However, you can only start a new skyscraper when necessary, meaning when no more floors can be added to the current skyscraper according to the rules.

Return the number of skyscrapers you can build using the given floors.

```python
def build_skyscrapers(floors):
    pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
print(build_skyscrapers([10, 5, 8, 3, 7, 2, 9]))
print(build_skyscrapers([7, 3, 7, 3, 5, 1, 6]))
print(build_skyscrapers([8, 6, 4, 7, 5, 3, 2]))
```

Example Output:

```
4
4
2
