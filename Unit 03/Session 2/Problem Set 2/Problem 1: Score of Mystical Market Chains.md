# Problem 1: Score of Mystical Market Chains

In the mystical market, chains of magical items are represented by a balanced parentheses string. Let A and B denote any balanced chains (including the simplest chain "()"). The score is defined recursively:

-   Base: `"()"` has a power score of 1. (Note: "()" itself is a valid A.)

-   Concatenation: If `A` and `B` are balanced chains, then `AB` has score `score(A) + score(B)`.

-   Enclosure: If `A` is a balanced chain, then `(A)` has score `2 × score(A)`.

Given a balanced string chain, return its total power score.

```python
def score_of_mystical_market_chains(chain):
  pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
print(score_of_mystical_market_chains("()"))
print(score_of_mystical_market_chains("(())"))
print(score_of_mystical_market_chains("()()"))
```

Example Output:

```
1
