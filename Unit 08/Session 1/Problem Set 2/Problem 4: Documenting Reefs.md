# Problem 4: Documenting Reefs

You are exploring a vast coral reef system. The reef is represented as a binary tree, where each node corresponds to a specific coral formation. You want to document the reef as you encounter it, starting from the `root` or main entrance of the reef.

Write a function `explore_reef()` that performs a preorder traversal of the reef and returns a list of the names of the coral formations in the order you visited them. In a preorder exploration, you explore the current node first, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your function. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity. Assume the input tree is balanced when calculating time and space complexity. 

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def explore_reef(root):
    pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
"""
         CoralA
        /     \
     CoralB  CoralC
     /   \      
 CoralD CoralE  
"""

reef = TreeNode("CoralA", 
                TreeNode("CoralB", TreeNode("CoralD"), TreeNode("CoralE")), 
                          TreeNode("CoralC"))

print(explore_reef(reef))
```

Example Output:

```markdown
['CoralA', 'CoralB', 'CoralD', 'CoralE', 'CoralC']
```
