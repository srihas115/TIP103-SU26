# Problem 5: Poseidon's Decision II

Poseidon has received advice on an important matter from his council of advisors. Help him evaluate the advice from his council to make a final decision. You are given the advice as the `root` of a binary tree representing a boolean expression.

- **Leaf nodes** have a boolean value of either `True` or `False`.
- **Non-leaf nodes** have two children and a string value of either `AND` or `OR`.

The **evaluation** of a node is as follows:
- If the node is a leaf node, the evaluation is the **value** of the node, i.e. `True` or `False`. 
- Otherwise evaluate the node's two children and apply the boolean operation of its value with the children's evaluations.

Return the boolean result of evaluating the `root` node. 

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your function. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity. Assume the input tree is balanced when calculating time and space complexity. 

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def get_decision(root):
    pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
"""
        AND
     /      \
   OR       AND
  /  \       /  \
True False True False
"""

root = TreeNode("AND")
root.left = TreeNode("OR")
root.right = TreeNode("AND")
root.left.left = TreeNode(True)
root.left.right = TreeNode(False)
root.right.left = TreeNode(True)
root.right.right = TreeNode(False)
print(get_decision(root))
```

Example Output: 

```markdown
False
Explanation: 
- Left Subtree Evaluation: True OR False evaluates to True
- Right Subtree Evaluation: True AND False evaluates to False
- Root and children Evaluation: True AND False evaluates to False
```
