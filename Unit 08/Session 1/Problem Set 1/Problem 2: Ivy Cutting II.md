# Problem 2: Ivy Cutting II

If you implemented `right_vine()` iteratively in the previous problem, implement it recursively. If you implemented it recursively, implement it iteratively.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your function. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity. Assume the input tree is balanced when calculating time and space complexity. 

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def right_vine(root):
  pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
"""
        Root
      /      \
    Node1    Node2
  /         /    \
Leaf1    Leaf2  Leaf3
"""
ivy1 = TreeNode("Root", 
                TreeNode("Node1", TreeNode("Leaf1")),
                TreeNode("Node2", TreeNode("Leaf2"), TreeNode("Leaf3")))

"""
      Root
      /  
    Node1
    /
  Leaf1  
"""
ivy2 = TreeNode("Root", TreeNode("Node1", TreeNode("Leaf1")))

print(right_vine(ivy1))
print(right_vine(ivy2))
```

Example Output:

```markdown
['Root', 'Node2', 'Leaf3']
['Root']
```
