# Problem 6: Plant Classifications

Given the `root` of a binary tree used to classify plants where each level of the tree represents a higher degree of speficity, return an array with the most specific plant classification categories (aka the leaf node values). Leaf nodes are nodes with no children.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your function. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity. Assume the input tree is balanced when calculating time and space complexity. 

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def get_most_specific(taxonomy):
    pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
"""
           Plantae
          /       \
         /         \
        /           \ 
Non-flowering     Flowering
   /      \       /        \
Mosses   Ferns Gymnosperms Angiosperms
                             /     \
                        Monocots  Dicots
"""
plant_taxonomy = TreeNode("Plantae", 
                          TreeNode("Non-flowering", TreeNode("Mosses"), TreeNode("Ferns")),
                                  TreeNode("Flowering", TreeNode("Gymnosperms"), 
                                          TreeNode("Angiosperms", TreeNode("Monocots"), TreeNode("Dicots"))))

print(get_most_specific(plant_taxonomy))
```

Example Output:

```markdown
['Mosses', 'Ferns', 'Gymnosperms', 'Monocots', 'Dicots']
```
