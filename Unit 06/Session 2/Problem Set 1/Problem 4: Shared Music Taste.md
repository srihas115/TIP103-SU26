# Problem 4: Shared Music Taste

Given the heads of two singly linked lists `playlist_a` and `playlist_b`, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two lists have no intersection at all, return `None`.

There are no cycles anywhere in either linked list. The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

```python
class Node:
	def __init__(self, value, next=None):
		self.value = value
		self.next = next

# For testing
def print_linked_list(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.value, end=" -> " if current.next else "")
        current = current.next
    print()

def playlist_overlap(playlist_a, playlist_b):
    pass
```

Example Usage:

![playlist_a and playlist_b merging into shared_segment](https://courses.codepath.org/course_images/tip103/unit6_session2/shared_music_taste_ex.png)

```python
playlist_a = Node('Song A', Node('Song B'))
playlist_b = Node('Song X', Node('Song Y', Node('Song Z')))
shared_segment = Node('Song M', Node('Song N', Node('Song O')))

playlist_a.next.next = shared_segment
playlist_b.next.next.next = shared_segment

intersection = (playlist_overlap(playlist_a, playlist_b))

if intersection:
    print(intersection.value)
else:
    print(intersection)
```

Example Output:

```markdown
Song M
```
