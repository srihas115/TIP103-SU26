# Problem 5: Double Listening Count

A new artist is blowing up and the number of people listening to their music has doubled in the last month. Given the head of a non-empty linked list `monthly_listeners` representing a non-negative integer without leading zeroes, return the `head` of the linked list after doubling its integer value. 

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

```python
class Node:
	def __init__(self, value, next=None):
		self.value = value
		self.next = next

# For testing
def print_linked_list(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.value, end=" -> " if current.next else "")
        current = current.next
    print()

def double_listeners(monthly_listeners):
    pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
monthly_listeners1 = Node(1, Node(8, Node(9))) # 189
monthly_listeners2 = Node(9, Node(9, Node(9))) # 999

print_linked_list(double_listeners(monthly_listeners1))
print_linked_list(double_listeners(monthly_listeners2))
```

Example Output:

```markdown
3 -> 7 -> 8
Example 1 Explanation: 189 * 2 = 378

1 -> 9 -> 9 -> 8
Example 2 Explanation: 999 * 2 = 1998
```
