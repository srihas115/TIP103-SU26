# Problem 5: Next Contestant to Beat

You are given the head of a linked list `contestant_scores` with `n` nodes where each node represents the current score of a contestant in the game. 

For each node in the list, find the value of the contestant with the next highest score. That is, for each score, find the value of the first node that is next to it and has a strictly larger value than it.

Return an integer array `answer` where `answer[i]` is the value of the next greater node of the `ith` node (1-indexed). If the `ith` node does not have a next greater node, set `answer[i] = 0`.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

# For testing
def print_linked_list(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.value, end=" -> " if current.next else "\n")
        current = current.next

def next_highest_scoring_contestant(contestant_scores):
    pass
```

Example Usage:

*Example 1*

![Linked List contestant_scores1 with dotted arrows to next greatest node](https://courses.codepath.org/course_images/tip103/unit6_session1/next_contestant_to_beat_ex1.jpg)

*Example 2*

![Linked List contestant_scores2 with dotted arrows to next greatest node](https://courses.codepath.org/course_images/tip103/unit6_session1/next_contestant_to_beat_ex2.jpg)

```python
contestant_scores1 = Node(2, Node(1, Node(5)))
contestant_scores2 = Node(2, Node(7, Node(4, Node(3, Node(5)))))

print(next_highest_scoring_contestant(contestant_scores1))
print(next_highest_scoring_contestant(contestant_scores2))
```

Example Output:

```markdown
[5, 5, 0]
[7, 0, 5, 5, 0]
```

To solve this problem, you may find it helpful to use a data structure we learned about in Unit 3: a stack!
