# Problem 1: Linked List Game

As the judge of the game show, you are given the `head` of a linked list of **even** length containing integers.

Each **odd-indexed** node contains an odd integer and each **even-indexed** node contains an even integer.

We call each even-indexed node and its next node a **pair**, e.g., the nodes with indices `0` and `1` are a pair, the nodes with indices `2` and `3` are a pair, and so on.

For every pair, we compare the values of the nodes in the pair:

- If the odd-indexed node is higher, the `"Odd"` team gets a point.
- If the even-indexed node is higher, the `"Even"` team gets a point.

Write a function `game_result()` that returns the name of the team with the higher points, if the points are equal, return `"Tie"`.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

# For testing
def print_linked_list(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.value, end=" -> " if current.next else "\n")
        current = current.next

def game_result(head):
    pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
game1 = Node(2, Node(1))
game2 = Node(2, Node(5, Node(4, Node(7, Node(20, Node(5))))))
game3 = Node(4, Node(5, Node(2, Node(1))))

print(game_result(game1))
print(game_result(game2))
```

Example Output:

```markdown
Even
Example 1 Explanation: There is only one pair in this linked list and that is (2,1).
Since 2 > 1, the Even team gets the point.
Hence, the answer is "Even".

Odd
Example 2 Explanation: There are 3 pairs in this linked list. 
Let's investigate each pair individually:
(2,5) -> Since 2 < 5, The Odd team gets the point.
(4,7) -> Since 4 < 7, The Odd team gets the point.
(20,5) -> Since 20 > 5, The Even team gets the point.
The Odd team earned 2 points while the Even team got 1 point and the Odd team has the higher points.
Hence, the answer is "Odd".

Tie
Example 3 Explanation: There are 2 pairs in this linked list. 
Let's investigate each pair individually:
(4,5) -> Since 4 < 5, the Odd team gets the point.
(2,1) -> Since 2 > 1, the Even team gets the point.
Both teams earned 1 point.
Hence, the answer is "Tie".
