# Problem 4: Calculate Prize Money

In the game show, contestants win prize money for each of the challenges they participate in. Write a function `get_total_prize()` that accepts the heads of two non-empty linked lists, `prize_a` and `prize_b`, representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each node represents a single digit. The function should add the two numbers and return the sum of the prize money as a linked list.

The digits of the sum should also be stored in reverse order with each node containing a single digit. 

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

# For testing
def print_linked_list(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.value, end=" -> " if current.next else "\n")
        current = current.next

def add_two_numbers(head_a, head_b):
    pass
```

Example Usage:

![342 and 465 and their sum 807 as linked lists with reversed digits](https://courses.codepath.org/course_images/tip103/unit6_session2/adding_up_the_evidence_ex1.jpg)

```python
head_a = Node(2, Node(4, Node(3))) # 342
head_b = Node(5, Node(6, Node(4))) # 465

print_linked_list(add_two_numbers(head_a, head_b))
```

Example Output:

```markdown
7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807 
```
