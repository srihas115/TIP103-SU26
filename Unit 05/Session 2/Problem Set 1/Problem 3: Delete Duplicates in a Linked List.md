# Problem 3: Delete Duplicates in a Linked List

Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, delete all elements that occur more than once in the list (*not just the duplicates*). The resulting list should maintain sorted order. Return the head of the linked list. 

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

# For testing
def print_linked_list(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.value, end=" -> " if current.next else "\n")
        current = current.next

def delete_dupes(head):
    pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
head = Node(1, Node(2, Node(3, Node(3, Node(4, Node(5))))))

# Linked List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
print_linked_list(delete_dupes(head))
```

Example Output:

```markdown
1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5
```
