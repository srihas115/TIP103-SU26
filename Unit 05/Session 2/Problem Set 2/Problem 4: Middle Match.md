# Problem 4: Middle Match

A variation of the two-pointer technique introduced earlier in the course is to have a slow and a fast pointer that increment at different rates. Given the `head` of a linked list, and a value `val`, use the slow-fast pointer technique to determine if `val` matches the middle node of the list. If there are two middle nodes, return `True` if the second middle node matches the value `val`.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

# For testing
def print_linked_list(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.value, end=" -> " if current.next else "\n")
        current = current.next

def middle_match(head, val):
    pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
kart_choices = Node("Bullet Bike", Node("Wild Wing", Node("Pirahna Prowler")))
tournament_tracks = Node("Rainbow Road", Node("Bowser Castle", Node("Sherbet Land", Node("Yoshi Valley"))))

print(middle_match(kart_choices, "Wild Wing"))
print(middle_match(tournament_tracks, "Bowser Castle"))
```

Example Output: 

```markdown
True
False
```
