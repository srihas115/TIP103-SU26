# Problem 3: Partition List Around Value

Given the `head` of a linked list with integer values and a value `val`, write a function `partition()` that partitions the linked list around `val` such that all nodes with values less than `val` come before nodes with values greater than or equal to `val`.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

# For testing
def print_linked_list(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.value, end=" -> " if current.next else "\n")
        current = current.next

def partition(head, val):
    pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
head = Node(1, Node(4, Node(3, Node(2, Node(5, Node(2))))))

print_linked_list(partition(head, 3))
```

Example Output:

```markdown
1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5
Explanation: There are multiple possible solutions.
E.g. 2 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3
```
