# Problem 1: Array to Linked List

Write a function `arr_to_ll()` that accepts an *array* of `Player` instances `arr` and converts `arr` into a linked list. The function should return the head of the linked list. If `arr` is empty, return `None`.

A function `print_linked_list()` is provided, which accepts the **head**, or first element, of a linked list and prints the `character` attribute of each `Player` in the linked list for testing purposes.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, character, kart):
        self.character = character
        self.kart = kart
        self.items = []

class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

# For testing
def print_linked_list(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.value.character, end=" -> " if current.next else "\n")
        current = current.next

def arr_to_ll(arr):
    pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
mario = Player("Mario", "Mushmellow")
luigi = Player("Luigi", "Standard LG")
peach = Player("Peach", "Bumble V")

print_linked_list(arr_to_ll([mario, luigi, peach]))
print_linked_list(arr_to_ll([peach]))
```

Example Output: 

```markdown
Mario -> Luigi -> Peach 
Peach
```
