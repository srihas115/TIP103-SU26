# Problem 5: Put it in Reverse

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the head of the reversed list. You must reverse the list in place. Return the head of the reversed list.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

# For testing
def print_linked_list(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.value, end=" -> " if current.next else "\n")
        current = current.next

def reverse(head):
	pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
kart_choices = Node("Bullet Bike", Node("Wild Wing", Node("Pirahna Prowler")))

print_linked_list(reverse(kart_choices))
```

Example Output: 

```markdown
Pirahna Prowler -> Wild Wing -> Bullet Bike
```
