# Problem 6: Symmetrical

Given the head of a singly linked list, return `True` if the values of the linked list nodes read the same forwards and backwards. Otherwise, return `False`. Use the two-pointer technique in your solution.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

# For testing
def print_linked_list(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.value, end=" -> " if current.next else "\n")
        current = current.next

def is_symmetric(head):
	pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
head1 = Node("Bitterling", Node("Crawfish", Node("Bitterling")))
head2 = Node("Bitterling", Node("Carp", Node("Koi")))

print(is_symmetric(head1))
print(is_symmetric(head2))
```

Example Output: 

```markdown
True
False
```
