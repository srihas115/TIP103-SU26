# Problem 6: Count Racers

Imagine a linked list used to track the order in which Mario Kart players finished in a race. The `head` of the list represents the first place finisher, and the tail or last node in the list represents the last place finisher.

Write a function `count_racers()` that accepts the `head` of the list and returns the number of players who participated in the race.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, player, next=None):
        self.player_name = player
        self.next = next

# For testing
def print_linked_list(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.player_name, end=" -> " if current.next else "\n")
        current = current.next

def count_racers(head):
    pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
racers1 = Node("Mario", Node("Peach", Node("Luigi", Node("Daisy"))))
racers2 = Node("Mario")

print(count_racers(racers1))
print(count_racers(racers2))
print(count_racers(None))
```

Example Output:

```markdown
4
1
0
```
