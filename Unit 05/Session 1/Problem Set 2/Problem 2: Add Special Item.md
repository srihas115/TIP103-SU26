# Problem 2: Add Special Item

Players can pick up special items as they race.

Update the `Player` class with a new method `add_item()` that takes in one parameter, `item_name`.

The method should validate the `item_name`.
- If the item is valid, add `item_name` to the player’s `items` attribute.
- The method does not need to return any values.<br>

`item_name` is valid if it has one of the following values: `"banana"`, `"green shell"`, `"red shell"`, `"bob-omb"`, `"super star"`, `"lightning"`, `"bullet bill"`.

```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, character, kart):
        self.character = character
        self.kart = kart
        self.items = []
        
    def add_item(self, item_name):
        pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
player_one = Player("Yoshi", "Dolphin Dasher")
print(player_one.items)

player_one.add_item("red shell")
print(player_one.items)

player_one.add_item("super star")
print(player_one.items)

player_one.add_item("super smash")
print(player_one.items)
```

Example Output:

```markdown
[]
['red shell']
['red shell', 'super star']
['red shell', 'super star']
```
