# Problem 7: Last Place

Imagine a linked list used to track the order in which Mario Kart players finished in a race. The `head` of the list represents the first place finisher, and the tail or last node in the list represents the last place finisher.

Given the `head` of the list, write a function `last_place()` that returns the `player_name` of the player that finished last in the race. If the list is empty, return `None`.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, player, next=None):
        self.player_name = player
        self.next = next

# For testing
def print_linked_list(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.player_name, end=" -> " if current.next else "\n")
        current = current.next

def last_place(head):
	pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
racers1 = Node("Mario", Node("Peach", Node("Luigi", Node("Daisy"))))
racers2 = Node("Mario")

print(last_place(racers1)) 
print(last_place(racers2)) 
print(last_place(None))
```

Example Output: 

```markdown
Daisy
Mario
None
```
