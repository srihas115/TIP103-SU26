# Problem 1: Player Class II

A class constructor is a special method or function that is used to create and initialize a new object from a class. Define the class constructor `__init__()` for a new class `Player` that represents Mario Kart players. The constructor accepts two required arguments: strings `character` and `kart`. The constructor should define three properties for a `Player`:
- `character`, a string initialized to the argument `character`
- `kart`, a string initialized to the argument `kart`
- `items`, a list initialized to an empty list

```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, character, kart):
        pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
player_one = Player("Yoshi", "Super Blooper")
print(player_one.character)
print(player_one.kart) 
print(player_one.items)
```

Example Output:

```markdown
Yoshi
Super Blooper
[]
```
